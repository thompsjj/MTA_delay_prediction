# The system structure owns all lines, stations and trips, 
# and it owns all update methods from the top down. 

# The system structure is capable of returning a clean list (JSON or dict) of 
# nodes and data belonging to those nodes. 
# This is then pipelined to the libpgm model.

# System reads from updates cleanly but also needs a topology for 
# lines that have contact through stations. 

# In the case of MTA it may be important to join nodes conditionally on track
# relationships alone. In this way, the topology of the network is in some
# sense changing. However, the way the MTA is designed, they avoid node
# congestion in general, as lines do not change tracks and run along their own
# course. In addition, MTA has a very large number of available tracks.
